# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A visually appealing web application that showcases modern web technologies, including Web Components, modern CSS, and Three.js for 3D graphics. The application will be designed with a focus on aesthetics, responsiveness, and interactivity, following the guidelines in `GEMINI.md`.

## Current Plan

**Objective:** Enhance the 3D scene to make it more visually interesting and interactive.

**Steps:**

1.  **HTML updates (`index.html`):**
    *   Add a title to the page.
    *   Import `OrbitControls` from Three.js examples for camera manipulation.
2.  **Scene Enhancement (`main.js`):**
    *   Add multiple objects with different geometries and materials.
    *   Add `AmbientLight` for softer overall illumination.
    *   Implement `OrbitControls` to allow the user to rotate, pan, and zoom the camera.
3.  **Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Add a title heading and style it.
    *   Style the main container to create a more polished look and feel.

## Project Outline

### Design and Styles

*   **Aesthetics:** Clean, modern design with a focus on visual balance and spacing. A subtle noise texture will be applied to the background to add a premium feel.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color palette is used for the 3D objects.
*   **Typography:** Expressive and readable fonts are used for the title.
*   **Layout:** Responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows will be used to create a sense of depth for UI elements.

### Features

*   **Interactive 3D Scene:** An interactive 3D scene rendered with Three.js, with camera controls.
*   **Web Components:** Reusable UI components for a modular structure (to be implemented).
